                <br>
            <h3>Registration</h3>

            Registration is done online through our website (www.giversfoundation.net) in which an application form can
            be completed online. If an applicant is accepted for registration, an invoice with bank details and student
            number will be sent together with final documents to be signed by an applicant. Registration will be
            finalised when proof of payment and signed documents are emailed and received by the institution. Thereafter
            an online meeting can be scheduled for induction.
            <br>
            <h3> Course fees</h3>
            All fees are to be deposited to the institution’s <a href="payments.html">bank account</a>. Only after acceptance of the application has
            been confirmed, registration fee or total course fee may be deposited.
            <br>
            <h3> ​Learning material and Devices</h3>

            The institution provides each student with free electronic learning material. Each student that enrolls for
            distance learning must have basic computer literacy skills and access to a laptop/computer or smartphone
            with Microsoft Word through which to complete electronic assessments, submit assessments, participate in
            classroom chat groups and attend webinars. Material printouts are available for contact learners.
            <br>

            <h3>Distance Learning and Contact Learning</h3>

            We offer both distance learning and contact learning sessions, so applicants must indicate during
            registration what mode of learning they prefer. Learning support will be provided to students through online
            webinar sessions and chat groups for distance learning students. Contact learning students will be
            facilitated in a classroom setup only at Pretoria Campus or at venue provided by the client organisation.

            Workshop/webinar dates and curriculum will be included in the programme handbook that will be sent together
            with learning material on or before induction date. The purpose of the webinar session is to prepare
            students for assessments and to give feedback on assessments. Distance learning students will receive all
            work electronically, and contact learning students will receive learning material hard copies .
            <br>
            <h3>Workplace/Practical assessments</h3>

            It is the student’s responsibility to find relevant workplace from which he/she will complete workplace
            assessments if applicable. Evidence will have to be provided that a student was exposed to workplace.

            <br>
            <h3> Final assessment</h3>

            Once all activities, assignments and assessments necessary to build a portfolio of evidence are submitted by
            student, an integrated assessment that demonstrates student’s ability to put theoretical knowledge to
            practice in a workplace must be submitted in form of pictures.
            <br>
